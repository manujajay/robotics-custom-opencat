# Robotics Custom Opencat

This repository provides resources and guidance for customizing the Opencat robotic cat. It includes instructions on adding advanced features such as sensors and enhanced mobility, as well as tips for modifying the design and programming for complex behaviors.

## Prerequisites

- A fully assembled Opencat robot
- Arduino IDE
- Additional components like sensors (e.g., ultrasonic sensors, IR sensors)
- Basic tools and supplies for hardware modifications

## Installation

### Hardware Modifications

1. Plan the modifications you want to implement, such as adding more sensors or altering the mechanical design for improved flexibility or stability.
2. Integrate new hardware components carefully, ensuring they do not interfere with the existing mechanics or electronics.

### Software Enhancements

1. Update the Arduino sketches to incorporate new sensors and features.
2. Modify the control algorithms to handle additional inputs and outputs.

## Customization Examples

### Adding a Vision Sensor

```cpp
// Arduino code snippet for integrating a vision sensor
#include <SPI.h>
#include <VisionSensor.h>

VisionSensor vs;

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
    vs.begin();
}

void loop() {
    if(vs.detectMotion()) {
        Serial.println("Motion detected!");
        // Add response behavior here
    }
}
```

### Enhanced Gait Customization

Customize the robot's walking patterns for different terrains or speeds.

```cpp
void customizeGait() {
    setStrideLength(20);  // Adjust stride length for speed
    setGaitPattern(ADVANCED);  // Use an advanced gait pattern for complex movements
}
```

## Contributing

We encourage contributions that enhance the customization options, improve the documentation, or expand the repository with new features. Please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
